# strategic-flip

Please implement a basic Othello game with the following features:

- An 8x8 game board, using green and white circles to represent the pieces
- Ability for two human players to take turns placing their pieces on the board by clicking 
- Enforce the rules of Othello:
  - A piece played must flank one or more of the opponent's pieces in any direction (horizontally, vertically or diagonally)
  - Any of the opponent's pieces flanked by the new piece are flipped to the current player's color
  - If a player cannot make a valid move, they must pass their turn
- Display the current scores for each player
- Detect when the game is over (no more valid moves) and display the winner

You can use a simple UI for now, the important part is getting the game logic working. We can improve the appearance later.
